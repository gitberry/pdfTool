# PDF tools - using older iTextSharp library  #

Something I built years ago for a project - decided to brush it off
and put in a public repository just to show what it could do 10 years ago...
I see that one thing never worked... I guess that project didn't need
that functionality...

The DLL is included - it's so old that the newer better 
versions of iTextSharp are in a difference license category
and I wasn't prepared to re-write or debug this old project - 
I'm probably going to do my next project that requires PDF with a javascript libarary.
